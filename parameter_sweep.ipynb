    "    * `rBP_size_r` = background subtraction via morphological opening. This is the most important pre-treatment step, usually always turned on. The parameter size is a tuple with (x,y) in pixels and correspond to an ellipsoid of this size.\n",
    "    * `fEMP_hmax_r` = findExtendedMaximaParameter. Extended Maxima, another filter to use for objects that contain several peaks of intensity, like for instance a higher resolution view of a cell nucleus where you might have a more granular texture. Our c-fos nuclear signal is typically imaged at low resolution, so the object only appears as a single peak, so we typically set the `hMax` parameter to \"None\".\n",
    "    * `fEMP_size_r` = size in pixels (x,y) for the structure element of the morphological opening. Typically set to 0 if `hMax` is not performed.\n",
    "    * `fEMP_threshold_r` = Typically set to \"None\" if `hMax` is not performed.\n",

This is the coordinate that will be saved in the point file. However, we noticed that often, the pixel that contains the highest intensity (the peak) is not always the center of the volume. This is likely due to potential deformations of the shape of the nucleus by the objective lens. If the parameter method is set to \"None\", then the peak intensity will be also the pixel at the center of the volume. Weâ€™ll set the parameter to \"Max\" to look if there is a voxel around the center that has a higher intensity than the center. \n",

    "    * `dCSP_threshold_r` = detectCellShapeParameter. The cell shape is not used for the cell detection itself (which is just searching for local maxima in intensity), but measuring the cell volume will be important to later remove the local peaks detected that do not correspond to an actual cell. The shape detection is done by a watershed, which will paint the volume of the cell from the detected center outwards. The threshold corresponds to the background intensity, and tells the watershed detection where to stop painting. This value is based on the background subtracted image here. If the threshold is set to None, then the cell shape detection is bypassed.\n",
